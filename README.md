# Pokémon Hunters of the Ancient

This is the decompilation of Pokémon Fire Red ROM, where the main works belongs to Pret.
Hunters of the Ancient is a Fire Red ROM hack which I had developed in 2012-2013, then abandoned it due to technical issues which I could not overcome.

Now with this project, I'll aim to remake my ROM hack from scratch and try to expand many features since the scripts of decompiled version is way much easier to modify.
